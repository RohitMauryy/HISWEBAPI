HISWEBAPI

Author:: Rohit Maurya

Description

HISWEBAPI is a RESTful Web API built using .NET Core designed to support Hospital Information Systems (HIS). It provides secure endpoints for managing hospital operations, including user authentication, branch management, and other core hospital functionalities. The API leverages a SQL Server database for data storage and uses IDistributedCache for efficient caching of frequently accessed data.

This project follows clean architecture principles, separating concerns between Controllers, Repositories, and Models, ensuring maintainability, scalability, and testability. It can serve as the backend for web-based hospital management dashboards, mobile applications, or other integrated hospital solutions.
